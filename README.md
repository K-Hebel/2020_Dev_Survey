### This repository contains an analysis of the 2020 StackOverflow Developer Survey which was circulated in February 2020.   

##### _This analysis includes a Jupyter Notebook which contains detailed information regarding datasets, links to original datasets and commentary on code used in this analysis._

 ## **Files Used :**
 The files used in this analysis were:
 1) The StackOverflow dataset - survey_results_public.csv
 2) The StackOverflow schema - survey_results_schema.csv
 3) IMF 2019 per capita gdp for select countries -
 imf_data.csv
 4) The jupyter notebook for this analysis - 2020 StackOverflow Survey - Project 1.ipynb

 ## **Summary Results :**
 A summary of the results of the analysis may be found at https://khebel.medium.com/.  The main premise of the analysis is to view desirable compensation as one weighted to the national per capita gdp of one's country location rather than the absolute value of that compensation.   Detailed notes on the analysis are contained in the jupyter notebook.


 ## **Acknowledgements :**
 This analysis relies on the StackOverflow dataset and IMF datasets.    The author also relied heavily on panda documentation for the coding process.  In addition, there was additional instructional benefit taken from courses on Udacity and Kaggle.   Markdown and dataframe formatting guidance were taken from https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ and https://mkaz.blog/code/python-string-format-cookbook/, respectively.  

## **Conclusion :**
The goal of this project is to remind all of us that measures of 'success' are relative, particularly when the primary measures are absolute numerical values that differ significantly between regions of the world.

This analysis is part of an iterative process and will continue to see improvements.  We appreciate your commentary, feedback and suggestions for improvement.  Thank you for your contributions.
